# sorting-app
App for Sorting. Currently has C++ implementation of sorting algorithms only.

## Inspiration
There are so many things in our real life that we need to search for, like a particular record in database, roll numbers in merit list, a particular telephone number in telephone directory, a particular page in a book etc. All this would have been a mess if the data was kept unordered and unsorted, but fortunately the concept of sorting came into existence, making it easier for everyone to arrange data in an order, hence making it easier to search.

## What it does
A Sorting Algorithm is used to rearrange a given array or list elements according to a comparison operator on the elements. 

## How we built it
This is a C++ file which has various sorting algorithms implemented.

## What's next for Sorting Algorithms
Algorithms have been implemented next we can give it a faceuplift and shift to a webpage. We can also create sorting visualizer which will visualize how the sort is taking place.
